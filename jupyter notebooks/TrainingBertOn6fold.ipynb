to the unknown\\nIf his wings were dry he knew he could fly\\nbut he could never make it home\\nHis legs they felt so heavy\\nas he dragged them through wet sand\\nHe just wanted to find shelter\\nin this vast and foreign land\\nHe could feel his back was burning\\nin the sweltering midday sun\\nThere were no beetles like him here\\nHe would be the only one\\nAs he crawled to higher ground\\nhe found shade under a tree\\nAnd laying right along his path\\nthe beetle found a seed\\nHe decided he would bury it\\nthis treasure he had found\\nHe then forgot that it was there\\nand it grew roots into the ground\\nThe beetle had long passed\\nbut the tree it grew and grew\\nFruit dropping from its branches\\nas life began anew\\nJust a tiny lonely beetle\\nwho didn't drown that day\\naffected

walls that I build out of fear \\nI hope you can hear\\nthe echoing sound as I tear them all down\\nand place those bricks in the sea\\nso I can watch them all drown\\nAnd now in its place there's a wide open space\\n to find some hope for the human race\\nI will let go of the hate and all of its weight\\nthat only drags me down and holds me in a state\\nof blaming anyone else for my fate\\nOn this day and in this very hour\\nI can build instead a beautiful tower\\nto hold inside the light and my power\\nAnd I know darkness will still come inside\\nI am only human and cannot hide\\nyet I know it can't stay because it won't abide\\nliving where it's nurtured and accepted\\nIt is used to being rejected and neglected\\nand that's how it thrives and enables the drives\\nthat soon we find take over our lives\\nKeep your enemies closer they say\\nand yet we push them away or keep them at bay\\nWhen the enemy is in us then where do we go\\nIf we resist it persists and this we should know\\nand if we don't want to see it then how can we grow\\nI will lay to waste my dreams of perfection\\nand will see my judgments as my reflection\\nI must know that each breath is a chance for resurrection\\n\\n\\x0cFight For The Sky\\n\\nIf I was the moon\\nand you were the sun\\nI would say you’re too hot\\nYou would say I’m no fun\\nYou would tell me I’m too humble\\nI would tell you

yourself\\nYou wouldn’t understand why parts of me hide\\nIf we could only stop being defensive\\nand trying to validate our own existence\\nIf only we could shine in our own time\\nwithout being met with so much resistance\\nIf only we could share the sky\\nwithout having to compete\\nWe might see that without us both\\nour world wouldn’t be complete\\n\\n\\x0cUP THERE\\n\\nThere once was a man\\nwho lived on top of his house\\nThe new neighbors assumed\\nhe must be a crazy old louse\\nHe had a tent on the roof\\nand would sweep off the leaves\\nHe fed a family of birds\\nnested in the eaves\\nEach day he'd wave to these neighbors\\nas they arrived home for the night\\nAnd when the sun went down\\nthey could see him turn on his light\\nHe would read his books\\nuntil midnight or so\\nand then crawl into his tent\\nwith his blanket in tow\\nSo one day these new neighbors\\nsaw him on the ground\\nHe said he needed some supplies\\nand had to go into town\\nSo they asked him why he does this\\nwhy he won't live inside\\nHe told them that a year ago\\nhis beloved wife had died\\nThat without her in their home\\nit just didn't feel the same\\nAnd he knows she wouldn't approve\\nof the sad old man that he became\\nSo one day he went up to the roof\\njust to try to get some air\\nand found that even though she's gone down here\\nhe could see her from up

with basking \\nAs I present myself, hair messy and dark circles throbbing \\nWalking into a room of friends after a night of drinking \\nBut I love it \\nWhen I enter the kitchen \\nFull of other people that saw me rocking and rolling the night before \\nMy head’s throbbing, but I crack a grin full of pride and bashfulness \\nAnd everyone laughs the knowing laugh \\nMutual admittance of our debauchery \\nMaybe there’s eggs cooking or hot mugs of coffee being cradled by loungers in their pajamas \\nAll together hungover \\nA girl recounts a dance floor makeup with glee and remorse \\nHer men’s beer boxers shocking my dignity for some reason \\nAnother is too dazed and stunned  by the magnitude of it all to even speak \\nBut a peaceful smile still lingers \\nAnd you are too wrapped up

dog paddling in some dark pool in my mind’s caverns \\nAnd yet I forget my own best friend’s favorite joke \\nI forget whole swaths of my childhood or college \\nAnd yet I still know her favorite cocktail at that Thai place downtown \\n\\nWhy can’t they be purged like a hard drive \\nWhy can’t the trite be easily erased \\n\\nSometimes you think you’ve done it \\nSometimes you think you’ve

miles will grow between you \\n\\nYou’ll still be able to call \\nBut often the connection becomes fuzzier \\nYou’ll hear reports from this wonderful new planet \\nBut you won’t really be able to taste the wine they’re drinking \\nThey’ll ask for stories from Earth with a hungry look in their eyes \\nOr he’ll forget what it’s like and your words will ring hollow \\n\\nHe says marriage is like a sleepover every night with your best friend \\nExcept you have get to have sex all the time \\n\\nIf the greatest joy in life is truly knowing another person \\nAnd the greatest comfort is being truly known \\nThen these planets must be full of joy and comfort \\nBut I’ve heard that a planet can get lonely \\nA man can find it wretched to be so distant from the rest of life \\nA man may long for Earth and think the grass will be greener \\n\\nI see many people try to buy a return ticket  \\nA return ticket can be very expensive \\n\\nIf marriage is so wonderful \\nWhy do I see so many rockets heading back to Earth \\nEach less one passenger  \\n\\nYou may like to buy a one way ticket one day \\nBut before you board the rocket \\nMake sure you’re heading to a planet full of life \\nWith a good atmosphere \\nA peaceful planet where storms rarely rage \\nIt’s hard to know what a planet will be like \\nWhat you see through the telescope \\nMight be different from the air you go to breathe \\n\\nBut when everyone is leaving Earth  \\nYou don’t want to be stuck there by yourself \\nSo grab a hand, go to the counter \\nAnd buy your tickets \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

you\\n\\n\\x0cNesssa Style Poetry \\n\\nBROKEN\\n\\nFor most my nights I use to cry myself to sleep and drench my pillow with tears\\n\\nBecause I was always haunted by one of my biggest fears\\n\\nWhich was waking up a another day and you wouldn’t be her  \\n\\nSome nights I even thought about killing myself hoping that would be my cure\\n\\nBut then it wouldn’t do me any good because then I wouldn’t have you\\n\\nSo I just lie down and cry because I worry and that’s the only thing I can do\\n\\nThere have been some close calls and it left me permanently scarred and broken\\n\\nAnd even though you tell me not to worry the pain already soak in \\n\\nSo each time the ambulance takes you away with speed as they rush\\n\\nThat makes me scared of losing you and that makes my insides crush\\n\\nBecause without you there will be no me, you are the air I breathe \\n\\nYou created the seed and gave this life to me\\n\\nMy heart is scattered but I promised you, I will try my best to deal with it, I swore\\n\\nBut each time that you are in pain, I am hurting twice much more\\n\\nSo that’s why sometimes when you go to the hospital, to me they won’t say\\n\\nBut they don’t have to tell me you’re in there because the way you feel, I feeling the same way\\n\\nAnd although I really try my best to stand tall and not show it\\n\\nAnyone who looks deep into my eyes, they already know it\\n\\nPeople even call me the day dreamer because I always stare out and think\\n\\nI call my heart the titanic because every day it feels like it’s going to sink\\n\\nBut I know you been through a lot and I just wish that I can take the pain for you \\n\\nAnd I know you don’t want me to think this way but what else can I do\\n\\nJust sit here and watch you hurt and feel all that horrible pain\\n\\nWell that just shatters my whole body and makes me want to go insane\\n\\nBecause I have to leave it up to the hands of the doctors and to them I’m thankful\\n\\nThey take good care of you and when you get out the hospital I’m joyful\\n\\nI just worry so much that it feels like I’m broken and my heart is melting like a candle\\n\\nBut papa you are so strong and tough and most the pain you already know how to handle\\n\\n\\x0cNesssa Style Poetry \\n\\nI am just your baby so I know that you would feel the same way if you were in my shoes\\n\\nTo see your daughter hurting and your hands were tied because there is nothing you can do\\n\\nI just wrote this poem to let you that I feel what you are going through\\n\\nAnd express the feelings that I had bottled up but mostly to show you how much I love you\\n\\nHottie\\n\\nMy definition of hot is not from just looks\\nI think it's sexy to be well familiar with books\\nBut the thing that attracts me is personality \\nThat's the only way you will get me in reality \\n\\nBig muscles, six pack, yup that's hot too\\nBut that can come with an ugly attitude \\nHead and ego so big there's no room for me\\nGreat to look at but not where I want to be\\n\\nA great respectable man really turns me on\\nSomeone with meaningful conversation to have all night long \\nA real man that has a good head on his shoulders\\nThe man that will wrap me in his jacket when nights get colder \\n\\nPushing my chair in, getting the door for me\\nA perfect gentleman is my definition of hot, you see \\nThe most gorgeous man on earth who catches my eyes\\nAre most likely cheaters and tell nothing but lies\\n\\nWhat's hot is when I can look in his eyes and know he's true \\nSomeone who can tell me it's ok when I'm feeling blue \\nHis action meet his words and I don't have to second guess \\nHe's not perfect but he does his very best \\n\\nA man with a big package is mostly just talk\\nProbably messes around with anything that walks\\nCould have an std or a lot of kids that he doesn't even see\\nAnd there's nothing hot about that to me\\n\\n\\x0cNesssa Style Poetry \\n\\nPersonality is the only thing that's going to catch my interest and attention \\nThe passion for love and life is a plus not to mention \\nBeautiful within and out, see now that's what I'm talking about \\nMy true definition of hot, no doubt\\n\\nMY TIME TO SHINE\\n\\nCan I trust you with a piece of my soul\\n\\nCan I tell you my hidden secrets and trust them in your possession to hold\\n\\nThis may be spontaneous but the stage is calling my name\\n\\nAnd the adrenaline inside of me is going insane\\n\\nThe vibration of the beat is bumping in my chest\\n\\nI never done this before as I close my eyes and pray for the best\\n\\nCan I trust you with my biggest fear\\n\\nI am scared of rejection but this just might just be my cure\\n\\nThis is my time to shine I am certain\\n\\nAs I pace back and forth behind the closed curtains \\n\\nAnd when they scream Vanessa come to the stage\\n\\nThe audience applause and gives me praise\\n\\nThe curtain opens as I get frozen and stuck\\n\\nBut I look up and ask God to wish me luck\\n\\nThe lights dim low and the spot light shines on me\\n\\nThis is my time to shine, this is meant to be\\n\\nMy mouth opens as the words flow into the microphone\\n\\nThese lyrics I own\\n\\nAs I feed your ears with a piece of my heart \\n\\nWhat did I start\\n\\n\\x0cNesssa Style Poetry \\n\\nI see smiles fill the room with all eyes drawn to me\\n\\nThis is my time to shine as I introduce you to creativity \\n\\nWith each word that I speak\\n\\nWith each tear that I weep \\n\\nOur emotions intertwine\\n\\nThe feelings you feel are mine\\n\\nThe crowd starts moving and swaying\\n\\nMany nodding their heads like they feel what I’m saying\\n\\nI notice my words start to draw you in close\\n\\nI can tell the crowd loves me the most\\n\\nPeople stand before I am done\\n\\nMatter of fact each and everyone\\n\\nI see people anticipating the snap\\n\\nI see people waiting to clap\\n\\nAnd when I’m done with my piece\\n\\nThe silence has come to a cease\\n\\nAs the crowd creates a unique beat\\n\\nWith snaps as they stomp their feet\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
