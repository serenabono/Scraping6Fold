https://www.sixfold.org/members/DougMAllen3,Douglass Allen,"Living my golden years as athlete, naturalist, photographer, and occasional poet, happily married after 50 years. Frustrated idealist still, and trying not to be cynical. Lifelong student and teacher. My three Sixfold poetry submissions have fared poorly, barely in the top 1/3rd, but my submissions to poetry journals have done better. I had 7 poems published last year. I'm not a fan of most prose poetry, most narrative poetry, and much post-modern points cynicism. My favorite contemporary poet is Billy Collins. Robert Frost is one of my favorite moderns. I read poems aloud and expect good poetry to show craft beyond those of an essay, diary, flash fiction, and other prose. Is it poetry- with sounds, rhythms, imagery that delight, stun, excite, or calm, and is it worth reading a second and third time?"

I think the methodology may be a little dodgy, but I might be wrong. Doesn't matter. I'm using it. It's pushed me to try to reach and connect with more people in my work--and I'm genuinely grateful for the feedback. It's lonely out there, as a poet--and each poem is like some contortionist's trick: that's what ""tell it slant"" means, it seems to me--that we can't just do what we've always done. That we have to do it differently, even at the risk of losing some readers. Just do me a favor: poetry doesn't explain itself, so don't ask it too, okay? And there's plenty of weird where I come from--not gratuitously, though. My weirdness is just documentary footage of the early part of the 21st Century. You all know what I'm talking about, too. We're in strange territory--getting stranger still, so it's a little bit of a miracle whenever I feel understood. Thanks. We'll write our way out of this mess."

It's pushed me to try to reach and connect with more people in my work--and I'm genuinely grateful for the feedback. It's lonely out there, as a poet--and each poem is like some contortionist's trick: that's what ""tell it slant"" means, it seems to me--that we can't just do what we've always done. That we have to do it differently, even at the risk of losing some readers. Just do me a favor: poetry doesn't explain itself, so don't ask it too, okay? And there's plenty of weird where I come from--not gratuitously, though. My weirdness is just documentary footage of the early part of the 21st Century. You all know what I'm talking about, too.

I think the key is to notice things and then find a way to capture or represent them in a way that resonates with people. I believe that becoming a good writer takes perception, creativity, imagination, and some talent, but it also requires persistence, bravery, and strength. It's very easy to be a poor writer. It's hard to be a good writer. It's nearly impossible to become a great writer. So I write. I write and write and write. Sometimes,(probably most of the time), it stinks. But sometimes flashes of quality flicker through the crap. And hopefully, as I continue to work on it, the flashes happen more often and the stuff in between gets less crappy all the time. Thank you for reading my work."

I think the methodology may be a little dodgy, but I might be wrong. Doesn't matter. I'm using it. It's pushed me to try to reach and connect with more people in my work--and I'm genuinely grateful for the feedback. It's lonely out there, as a poet--and each poem is like some contortionist's trick: that's what ""tell it slant"" means, it seems to me--that we can't just do what we've always done. That we have to do it differently, even at the risk of losing some readers. Just do me a favor: poetry doesn't explain itself, so don't ask it too, okay? And there's plenty of weird where I come from--not gratuitously, though. My weirdness is just documentary footage of the early part of the 21st Century. You all know what I'm talking about, too. We're in strange territory--getting stranger still, so it's a little bit of a miracle whenever I feel understood. Thanks. We'll write our way out of this mess."

I prefer to consider myself a writer, poet and photographer who is also interested in film rather than use the more general term: ""artist."" It seems somehow pretentious and less specific. I am fluent in three languages English, French, and Creole, with moderate Spanish skills, and though I'm not sure if that has any relevance here, I thought it would be a good mention. Maybe to show my Haitian roots and upbringing. Maybe that means something. I was introduced to American photography and American literature between 2008 and 2009 and I have never looked back, sometimes to my financial unease. Woes and woes.

I'm not a fan of most prose poetry, most narrative poetry, and much post-modern points cynicism. My favorite contemporary poet is Billy Collins. Robert Frost is one of my favorite moderns. I read poems aloud and expect good poetry to show craft beyond those of an essay, diary, flash fiction, and other prose. Is it poetry- with sounds, rhythms, imagery that delight, stun, excite, or calm, and is it worth reading a second and third time?"

One of my great passions is life because I have walked this path by sharing it with amazing people. People that have taught me to see the world in a very different way. Extraordinary individuals have showed me what I would have never discovered by myself. I am an eager reader of science, poetry, politics, and music (yes, the meaning and composition of song lyrics). I have a great appreciation for art, languages, and the expression of everyone's perspective seen from the lens of a camera. I love Astronomy and one day I will be in space. I am a Research Scientist in Corrosion Engineering and writing is a great way for me to tell the world how I feel."

For some reason, I developed an intense craving to read anything with a musical feel in it. I started to read anything, by anybody, who struck me with this vibe - Diane Ackerman, Christina Rossetti, William Shakespeare, etc. I enrolled in two semesters of poetry writing classes, a few other creative writing courses, and two more on the topic of analyzing Shakespearean plays for their symbolism, metaphor, and language style. My fascination with the power of language and metaphor became deep, and lasting. From there I continued to expand my education, to read widely, and combine ideas. Over time, I started writing my own poetry. Now, I am ready to share it with you, but only if you are ready to receive it."

I have battled with an autoimmune disease since the age of 4 years old. I am now 20 years old and my 16 year fight is still not over. My days of pain and emotional frustration and confusion led me to take up a pencil and paper and write. The manuscript I have submitted is short and simple, yet in my opinion a breath of fresh air. Take a reading to it! I hope it is another key to unlocking strength in your heart and inspiration in your mind!"

Reading/performing is just as important to me as writing, and I enjoy listening to other poets. I particularly like Spoken Word open mics--the way that poetry is powerfully embodied in the poet, the reactions and interjections of the audience, and the range in age you'll find there. I still have a long way to go as a poet (and I'm sure there will always be room for evolvement and improvement) so I sincerely appreciate constructive feedback. I explore many different themes in my poetry, including family, mental illness, gender, sexuality (including kink), and trauma."

Now she shares her time between the Island of Martha’s Vineyard, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland. She is a writer, artist and poet whose work appears in numerous publications including Poetry Scotland, DeLuge Journal and Cape Cod Poetry Review, as well as in experimental film and multimedia installations. Involved in the current eco-tone poetic dialog, Baird describes being raised in San Francisco on the pabulum of the west coast literary and art renaissance. Very much a part of the “wide-open” poetry movement started by Ferlinghetti, offering up poems as a language of shared experience, her poems are intentionally accessible and often visual, unfolding stories through descriptive imagery. M. R. Baird currently has two books in print – “Uplands,” and “Valentines and other Tragedies,” published by Plum Press."

After two more children arrived, needed to make more money and became a new home salesman. Now retired. Recently have just completed conducting two poetry classes in assisted living centers for the elderly in Austin and Wimberley. I write poetry to stay sane in a sometimes insane world."

Also, in the literal sense, I could not have an intelligent conversation about, say, punctuation, with a teenager in high school. But I do pretty good at proofing my own work. I am also a very big reader. That helps me in many ways concerning my writing and if it has any merit. There's a lot to be said when it comes down to good writing and its value.

I am a musician/singer/songwriter, and I work in corporate America in order to pay the bills. I have a BA in Communication and am working on my MBA. I decided to pursue the MBA mostly to delay paying my student loans back, but also to make myself more marketable, which means I may be wasting a lot of time if this writing thing works out. I have a large family which would require a drawing of a very complicated tree in order to explain it properly, so let’s just say I have a gaggle of kids, biological and otherwise, and I love them all.

I had what it took to write---I was in favor of the written word, I had a goofy family, a sick bunch of friends, and a computer--- so I marched into the office of our local newspaper and pitched the idea of writing a humor column each week. The editor was skeptical. It was a small town and he knew me so he felt compelled to ask me ""Will it be the truth? You know, as a newspaper that is what we publish."" I thought for a moment. ""It'll be LIKE the truth, only way better."" The editor gulped and slid me a contract across the table. I wrote for our local newspaper for 8 years before we moved to the Eastern Shore about 18 months ago. Funny things are still happening around me, I am still in favor of the written word, my family will never get it together, my new friends are a sick bunch, and I still have a computer---so I guess I am not done writing yet."

Often times I am more, as when I'm with my son in the car, or when I'm with my wife contemplating our lawn, which needs much work, situated, as it is, in Wisconsin. Sometimes I am less, especially after just having given up. Perhaps, for instance, at the conclusion of a game of chess. Often times my son's cat ""Kitty"" can be found asleep in the second story of my closet on this or that folded shirt. As a family, we like thunderstorms, while individually, especially Kitty and my son, not so much. If you wish to look us up we can be found at the Red Putter Miniature Golf Course in Door County, WI, the 3rd Wednesday in August each year at approximately 1:00."

I love making connections between the arts, whether music/word/art/dance and actively participate in collaborations. I turned to writing in English, but am bilingual English/French and love thinking in different languages, playing with sound systems. I love how writing offers the opportunity to explore what my imagination only starts to hint at. Reading well, revising carefully, helping others to do the same are wonderful passions to have! I also love playing piano! For the moment, I am concentrating on Rachmaninoff, Ravel, Debussy and Chopin. Something about the latter part of the 19th century/early 20th draws me strongly but I try to be aware and in tune of the current world about me...

Writing has been my passion since I first learned to read and write. It is my way of keeping balanced in good times and sane in bad ones. The written word helps me to better understand my world and my self. I have written poems, short stories, and have kept many years worth of diaries and journals. Marriage, children, and two decades of working with high risk youth and families left little time or energy to seriously pursue a career as a writer. In the last two years I have at last had the time and opportunity to enroll in writing courses at my community college. Only close friends, family, and my writing teachers and classmates have been privy to the results of this tilting at windmills. Their encouragement has emboldened me to begin submitting some of my prose and poetry pieces. I am currently working on a novel and a short story collection and always, poetry."

I have been writing since I could hold a pen--albeit, writing began merely as scribbles of which, as a two year old with chapped lips and wide blue eyes, I was quite proud. I completed my first chapter book when I was seven, and continued to write chapter books and novels, determined to get at least one of them published. Now, at twenty-two, I still have no published novels, but I've published some poems and a couple short articles. I feel as though I have something to say, and a voice with which to say it, and with that conviction, I hope to let my words out and see them find their ways into the hands of readers. At the same time, I know my writing has yet to be chiseled into the perfection I wish it to be, and receiving input from other writers is one of the best ways to reach that goal. I hope we may all help each other both to write our best and to also see our writings find the light of day."

I went to California State University, Northridge to get a degree in film production, but to graduate within a reasonable amount of time, I reluctantly changed my emphasis to screenwriting. I'm so glad I did. After graduation, I wrote a few screenplays, but never sold anything. Plus, screenplays didn't satisfy my new writing urges. I started writing novels. I have written four, but maybe the first three were practice to get me to write my latest one, ""Six Days."" I hired a professional editor, Kristen Weber, who has been helping me with drafts for over a year.

My publications have covered the spectrum from acrostics to essays to a billboard haiku, and like many literary artists, I do have a novel I hope to one day see in print. My true passion however, is poetry, primarily contemporary works and haiku. It is my hope that when someone reads my work, they will feel less alone in the world, or say to themselves, “I’ve been there too.” Writing, poetry in particular, does no good collecting dust in a drawer; it is meant to be shared and experienced and if I’m so blessed, to touch a heart. This is my ultimate goal. Lord Byron (1788-1824) said it best, “but words are things, and a small drop of ink falling like dewdrops upon a thought, produces that which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think."""

At age 17 I fell in love with my Italian teacher (I was doing a language degree by correspondence) and moved to Sydney to be with him. I gave birth to my first son at age 18 and went on to have 5 children. I dropped out of my degree but returned to it, part time, 5 years ago. I'm now in the equivalent of 3rd year and the majors are in Spanish and Italian. For years I wrote little and only for myself, however a personal crisis provoked by the death of my computer and the loss of everything I'd been working on in the last few years, inspired me to begin writing prolifically again.

My high school English teachers encouraged me to write, but I didn't get around to it until late in life when I learned that you can't grow until you let others comment on your efforts. I've submitted stories to many journals, some keeping them for years, before rejecting them. Nonetheless, I will be published even if I have to do it myself. As I entered this contest and read other's work, I know there's lots of great unpublished stories that need to be read."

Frustrated idealist still, and trying not to be cynical. Lifelong student and teacher. My three Sixfold poetry submissions have fared poorly, barely in the top 1/3rd, but my submissions to poetry journals have done better. I had 7 poems published last year. I'm not a fan of most prose poetry, most narrative poetry, and much post-modern points cynicism. My favorite contemporary poet is Billy Collins. Robert Frost is one of my favorite moderns. I read poems aloud and expect good poetry to show craft beyond those of an essay, diary, flash fiction, and other prose. Is it poetry- with sounds, rhythms, imagery that delight, stun, excite, or calm, and is it worth reading a second and third time?"

Now in my fifties, I still enjoy reading these works aloud to my wife, or listening to her recite them in her animated, storytelling style. Some joys never go out of style. In my last year of high school my biggest influence was Neal Peart, R.I.P, drummer and lyricist for the rock band Rush. He inspired the structure and rhyme of several poems I wrote in my late teens and early twenties. Fast forward through the decades and most recently I have been enjoying the works of Kabir, Mary Oliver, and Hafez. There have been long periods, even years, when I have produced no poetry, at least not that I put to paper. Got to get busy making up for lost time now!

I believe that becoming a good writer takes perception, creativity, imagination, and some talent, but it also requires persistence, bravery, and strength. It's very easy to be a poor writer. It's hard to be a good writer. It's nearly impossible to become a great writer. So I write. I write and write and write. Sometimes,(probably most of the time), it stinks. But sometimes flashes of quality flicker through the crap. And hopefully, as I continue to work on it, the flashes happen more often and the stuff in between gets less crappy all the time.

Now in my fifties, I still enjoy reading these works aloud to my wife, or listening to her recite them in her animated, storytelling style. Some joys never go out of style. In my last year of high school my biggest influence was Neal Peart, R.I.P, drummer and lyricist for the rock band Rush. He inspired the structure and rhyme of several poems I wrote in my late teens and early twenties. Fast forward through the decades and most recently I have been enjoying the works of Kabir, Mary Oliver, and Hafez.

I have always loved music, and found from early on that lyrics are what most spoke to me. For years, that was largely the extent of my contact with poetry. However, during quarantine I began to explore and take an increased interest in written poetry. Though a math and finance major in college with limited creative writing experience, I have found much satisfaction and joy in the process of creating poetry and expressing myself through the written word."

I have a bachelors in game and simulation programming which I have utilized in the commercial field and for personal gains in order to create narratives that explore the complexities of groups that don’t get represented enough in more unique ways. As well I spend an absurd amount of time expanding my knowledge on the intricacies of the world and the Universe as time rolls forward for me.

Throughout his work, we are urgently reminded that as much as we occupy our spaces we are also shaped by them. William’s work has appeared in LandEscapes Journal, The Phoenix, and Sun Magazine.

Now in my fifties, I still enjoy reading these works aloud to my wife, or listening to her recite them in her animated, storytelling style. Some joys never go out of style. In my last year of high school my biggest influence was Neal Peart, R.I.P, drummer and lyricist for the rock band Rush. He inspired the structure and rhyme of several poems I wrote in my late teens and early twenties. Fast forward through the decades and most recently I have been enjoying the works of Kabir, Mary Oliver, and Hafez.

https://www.sixfold.org/members/madibara,Madison Baranoski,"I began writing when I was fourteen as a means of survival. At times, writing helped me fight for my own existence. Having worked in the fields of special and general education, service, and mental health, I have spent little time pursuing writing professionally. However, writing has always been my first love. The relationship has continued for nearly 10 years. I am endlessly grateful for the people I have met through the world of poetry - one of which is myself. Not in the sense of rebirth, but rather self-discovery. I believe that poetry can save individuals, communities, and the world itself. I hope to be a part of it."

https://www.sixfold.org/members/brianwebb196,Brian Webb,"I am always trying to be a better writer. I think the key is to notice things and then find a way to capture or represent them in a way that resonates with people. I believe that becoming a good writer takes perception, creativity, imagination, and some talent, but it also requires persistence, bravery, and strength. It's very easy to be a poor writer. It's hard to be a good writer. It's nearly impossible to become a great writer. So I write. I write and write and write. Sometimes,(probably most of the time), it stinks. But sometimes flashes of quality flicker through the crap. And hopefully, as I continue to work on it, the flashes happen more often and the stuff in between gets less crappy all the time. Thank you for reading my work."

I am focused now on short stories but have a large collection of non-fiction stories about parenting and have dabbled in poetry (which clearly means that I am NOT a poet--just a lover of words).

https://www.sixfold.org/members/jsamuelbaker,Sam Baker,"My earliest poetry and rhyme influences and inspirations included nursery rhymes, fairy tales, and Dr Seuss stories, all of which I had the good fortune to revisit as an adult - to read aloud to my two daughters when they were young. Now in my fifties, I still enjoy reading these works aloud to my wife, or listening to her recite them in her animated, storytelling style. Some joys never go out of style. In my last year of high school my biggest influence was Neal Peart, R.I.P, drummer and lyricist for the rock band Rush. He inspired the structure and rhyme of several poems I wrote in my late teens and early twenties. Fast forward through the decades and most recently I have been enjoying the works of Kabir, Mary Oliver, and Hafez. There have been long periods, even years, when I have produced no poetry, at least not that I put to paper. Got to get busy making up for lost time now!

I couldn't sleep for several nights until the piece was done. I expected that was the end of it until early last year when one of my nephews died unexpectedly. The same scenario; I couldn't rest for days on end. This has been an extraordinarily painful experience. Several pieces came out of that event and I've written a few more concerning my nephew since my first SIXFOLD submittals These are from a group written later that year.

I could tell you where I am from and about how writing is my passion and so on but there is something so disingenuous about that.

My grammar is skewed but yet you will get the point.

Having worked in the fields of special and general education, service, and mental health, I have spent little time pursuing writing professionally. However, writing has always been my first love. The relationship has continued for nearly 10 years. I am endlessly grateful for the people I have met through the world of poetry - one of which is myself. Not in the sense of rebirth, but rather self-discovery. I believe that poetry can save individuals, communities, and the world itself. I hope to be a part of it."

I think the key is to notice things and then find a way to capture or represent them in a way that resonates with people. I believe that becoming a good writer takes perception, creativity, imagination, and some talent, but it also requires persistence, bravery, and strength. It's very easy to be a poor writer. It's hard to be a good writer. It's nearly impossible to become a great writer. So I write. I write and write and write. Sometimes,(probably most of the time), it stinks. But sometimes flashes of quality flicker through the crap. And hopefully, as I continue to work on it, the flashes happen more often and the stuff in between gets less crappy all the time.

The art of words led me to discover a world of pleasure, and passion. Through poetry I learned to see people, life and emotions in a more colorful way. I learned that I had the ability to transform pain into something alluring. I'm now a Literature teacher in order to better the only language that I feel comfortable using to express myself: English. I'm the author of The Modeling Guide for Every Body, a modeling guide written based on my experiences as a model and aimed to help young woman enter the modeling industry, and Marshal Sea, a poetry collection inspired by a love story that takes place in the Island of Santorini. My latest work, Seven Days, Twelve Months and a Year, is a poetry collection inspired on the Divine Comedy and is looking for a publishing house."

My three Sixfold poetry submissions have fared poorly, barely in the top 1/3rd, but my submissions to poetry journals have done better. I had 7 poems published last year. I'm not a fan of most prose poetry, most narrative poetry, and much post-modern points cynicism. My favorite contemporary poet is Billy Collins. Robert Frost is one of my favorite moderns. I read poems aloud and expect good poetry to show craft beyond those of an essay, diary, flash fiction, and other prose.

Poetry wasn't even on the radar for me. When my younger brother died due to an overdose and was homeless at the time; I experienced an overwhelming need to write down my thoughts, in lieu of providing a eulogy. It resulted in a poem. I couldn't sleep for several nights until the piece was done. I expected that was the end of it until early last year when one of my nephews died unexpectedly. The same scenario; I couldn't rest for days on end. This has been an extraordinarily painful experience. Several pieces came out of that event and I've written a few more concerning my nephew since my first SIXFOLD submittals These are from a group written later that year. They don't appear to be 'about' him but are certainly 'because' of him. Written during that period of grieving; while still in a highly emotional/receptive state, it is my only explanation in dealing with closure."

As a body worker and student of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I focus on healing. How can writing be healing for me and to readers? I also find the body to be a fascinating metaphor.

I've shared a love for reading and writing poetry since I was in middle school; I find it to be incredibly therapeutic. One could argue that Poetry is the most loyal friend I've ever had; she has allowed me to fully express myself at times that I was hesitant to and served as a safe haven during times of trauma. From writing about the blissful days of being a teenager in high school to more challenging ones to poems about heartache, grief, and trauma-- poetry has always been there."

I recognise that I still have a long way to go, but I am proud of each new achievement, whether it's reading through a piece of work and thinking ""Yes, that sounds how I wanted it to sound"", or whether it's comparing the quality of my writing to what I was producing a year ago. Sometimes it's a ""well done"" from another writer whose opinion I value. For me, writing sits somewhere between a hobby and an obsession. Probably the latter, if you ask my husband! In real life, I work as an English Teacher in a British Secondary School in Valencia, Spain. I fit writing around a forty-hour week of teaching, marking, parents' meetings and preparation. A tiring equation but rewarding as well!"

Thus, I entered the MFA program at the University of New Orleans to learn how to translate ideas for stories into stories.

Maybe to show my Haitian roots and upbringing. Maybe that means something.

My three Sixfold poetry submissions have fared poorly, barely in the top 1/3rd, but my submissions to poetry journals have done better. I had 7 poems published last year. I'm not a fan of most prose poetry, most narrative poetry, and much post-modern points cynicism. My favorite contemporary poet is Billy Collins. Robert Frost is one of my favorite moderns. I read poems aloud and expect good poetry to show craft beyond those of an essay, diary, flash fiction, and other prose. Is it poetry- with sounds, rhythms, imagery that delight, stun, excite, or calm, and is it worth reading a second and third time?"

I couldn't sleep for several nights until the piece was done. I expected that was the end of it until early last year when one of my nephews died unexpectedly. The same scenario; I couldn't rest for days on end. This has been an extraordinarily painful experience. Several pieces came out of that event and I've written a few more concerning my nephew since my first SIXFOLD submittals These are from a group written later that year.

Consequently, reading and writing have become forefront activities of mine, among other things, as a means to discover ""truth"" (I place truth in parentheses due to the fact I am still trying to define what truth is, assuming it even can be defined). What I usually find myself admiring most in people (and myself), are aspects of themselves that are truly genuine, regardless if these aspects are at large considered cool, interesting, unique, etc., though they oftentimes are those things, too. Like truth, if not reflecting truth itself, what is genuine is a topic of continual philosophical debate and an endeavor I find most appealing for what better life is there than one lived genuinely and in accord with truth? While my ultimate goal in writing is to pursue truth of self and the world, I am quite content with the fun of it and any mutual solidarity it forges."

https://www.sixfold.org/members/leinafinnegan,Leina Finnegan,"I am a self published poet of two books, ""Unspoken Feelings"" and ""Poetry of a Noble Heart"". I have been writing since I was in elementary. Some of my poetry as a child have been published in my school's newspaper. I joined Instagram in August of 2017 with the intent to have a platform where I could freely express myself and not be confined to restrictions. The art of my poetry is drafted through my existence amidst my distress and contentment. Through writing, I am both a naked nemesis and a stripped soul. By sharing my poems with you, I am sharing fractions of myself. Matters of the heart and mind are bound to be misconstrued when I speak and that is why I turn to poetry. I have always found poetry to be a haven, somewhere I can reside without having to conform, a means of expressing myself when words that passed through my lips failed to do so."

Also, I host and curate creative writing workshops and poetry reading circles in my hometown. My work is used as a voice to advocate for those that cannot speak. Advocating for foster care youth, special needs children, and domestic violence victims is fulfilled passion. Previously I represented Cleveland, OH in 2007 PSI Competition. In 2008 I made my second team in Atlanta, GA. In 2014 I was selected by YWCA Cleveland to pay tribute to Maya Angelou on channel 19 news.

I write about my struggles and feelings, and most of the time when I write, it starts out negative, but ends with a positive outlook. I would LOVE to help people through my writing.

I write mostly comedy and satire and dabble in sci-fi and other young adult formats. I like red wine, long walks on the beach, and writing about whatever crazed and absurd experiences come my way. My view on being a successful writer is that you have to actually write, and you have to not only accept criticism but seek it out. You can't just call yourself a writer, you have to actually be one. It's like the Burgess Meredith quote, which is also my personal moto in life: ""You can wish in one hand and crap in the other and see which fills first"" -Burgess Meredith Doing trumps not doing."

When a basement boiler explodes, infamous creatures the military has secretly housed underground awaken and mayhem becomes the campus. A few months later I finished a second cross-genre mystery, ""Annie’s Enviable Position,” also self-published on Amazon. Its action takes place in New York (2016), Paris (1909) and Podunk, Romania (1970s-80s). Like vampires, my dhampires can fly through time and space when they receive memory calls. This year I have finished a romcom screenplay, “A Million at Your Disposal,” signed with my real name, while keeping up my satirical site, thepotholeview.com.

A few years ago I retired from Kaiser Hospital’s IT department. I did return to Korea for another two and a half years with my wife and two daughters and worked in a Korean bank for Bank of America. My only formal poetry training was one class I audited in Hawaii given by Phyllis Thompson, the author of “Artichoke and other poems”.

https://www.sixfold.org/members/senecabasoalto,Seneca Basoalto,"Seneca Basoalto is a student of Psychology and Philosophy, aiding in (and confusing) her histrionic observations and perceptions of her personal relationships. With a nearly non-existent childhood due to frequent moving, and a background in the backstage music/movie scene, she’s congregated many strange experiences – and used them to fuel her gutsy, insightful writings. When Seneca isn’t diligently working on her writing, you can most likely find her on her living room floor listening to records, shouting at people from her car, or marathoning horror movies. For now she resides in the Black Hills. You can read more of her work on her website, as well as find links to her current book for sale."

I study literature and poetry at a tiny college in southern Vermont and while I'm not there, I'm usually building or splitting things—mostly wooden things. My writing is both stressful and relieves me of stress simultaneously. It's a way for me to tell somebody—only my notebook, usually—all that I hide in my day-to-day life. In these nighttime hours, I can lose myself in writing and hope that, after the poem is done, I will build myself back up, and even a little higher, this time. Sometimes it works, often it doesn't. I hope you all enjoy my poetry. I hope you can find me in it."

My writing tends to be somewhat dark, dealing with conflict, loss, mortality, violence, and the difficulty, anger and heartbreak that come with remaining a true human being in a world going mad. I believe in hope, too, but hope is a word that's thrown around far too casually with no regard for its hidden dangers. To be truly alive is to feel, and to truly feel is to hurt."

I spend much of my time wondering what it means to be an ethical bureaucrat, and where decisions and free will intermix. I offset the left-brain demands of my job by letting my right brain take over my computer at night. Soaking up new knowledge keeps me happy even if it doesn’t let me sit still. In the rest of my spare time Russian history, neuroscience, literature, squirrel social dynamics, data analysis, and behavioral psychology make my brain fire on all neurons.

I'm the daughter of a school teacher and an electrician, and I have three diverse brothers: an aspiring nurse, a hardworking cowboy, and a introvert who sticks closely to his computer screen. I'm engaged to an aspiring photographer. I am passionate about many things in my life, including social justice, animal rights, and equality. My writing is inspired significantly through my emotions. My mind is like a hurricane thrashing around and the only way to really calm it is through the written word. I use this medium to cope with my anxiety and depression, to express what I can't articulate verbally, and to sort through truths and lies."

I attended Penn State for a BA in Literature. I didn't complete, though I am working to raise the funds to go back and complete my degree. I've had a passion for writing poetry and songs for as long as I can remember. I performed an original poem that started as a class assignment for my parents when I was seven, and I wrote my first short story in second grade. It was a horror tale of children being attacked by the witch that lives down the street while trick-or-treating on Halloween, and their epic escape from her haunted house. I wrote two more short stories as a Sophomore in college consisting of adult topics, lies, crimes and decite. I completed and participated in several open-mic events. I was a youth member of the Philadelphia Youth Poetry movement. As a Junior in college I completed a rough draft of a poetry book I plan to get published. I also like to sing, draw and perform."

I maintain a regular poetry writing practice and am in the beginning stages of a novel. I’ve also recently begun attending a weekly writer’s workshop.

My love of good writing goes back to early childhood, and I've relatively recently rediscovered my love of doing my own writing. I enjoy anything edgy, unconventional, and challenging. My writing tends to be somewhat dark, dealing with conflict, loss, mortality, violence, and the difficulty, anger and heartbreak that come with remaining a true human being in a world going mad. I believe in hope, too, but hope is a word that's thrown around far too casually with no regard for its hidden dangers. To be truly alive is to feel, and to truly feel is to hurt."

But that changed in March of 2014: I kept going into the office, but instead of working, all I could do was scribble out poems as they were coming to me. Before one ended, the other had already begun. It was this orgasmic explosion that, in retrospect, had been building up under suppression. Some of the suppression came from being bullied in the past, and some came from closed-minded religion. But on that day in March, a part of me died, and another part was born."

Since childhood, I have been deeply interested in the big questions of life and I'm convinced that each one of us has a source of wisdom within that can guide us along the way. For me, the most direct access to precise guidance comes through contemplative writing. I have come to realize that while we each have our unique individual journeys, the insights we gain from our path are universally relevant. And when we share our own insights, we uplift ourselves and each other. That's what I hope to accomplish through my poetry: upliftment of self and others.

https://www.sixfold.org/members/JanMarie,Janet Marie Good,"Several years ago I decided enough was enough. I had what it took to write---I was in favor of the written word, I had a goofy family, a sick bunch of friends, and a computer--- so I marched into the office of our local newspaper and pitched the idea of writing a humor column each week. The editor was skeptical. It was a small town and he knew me so he felt compelled to ask me ""Will it be the truth? You know, as a newspaper that is what we publish."" I thought for a moment. ""It'll be LIKE the truth, only way better."" The editor gulped and slid me a contract across the table. I wrote for our local newspaper for 8 years before we moved to the Eastern Shore about 18 months ago. Funny things are still happening around me, I am still in favor of the written word, my family will never get it together, my new friends are a sick bunch, and I still have a computer---so I guess I am not done writing yet."

She considers herself to be a feminist writer, and is usually inclined to write more realistic fiction with female protagonists. Her stories try to tackle the characters' psychological problems, as well as their social issues. And while she dabbles in both poetry and prose,  she feels she is better suited for prose. From a young age, Baheya started creating stories. At first it was to amuse herself, but as she grew she found putting words on a page/screen to be quite a liberating experience. Reflecting primarily on her own experiences, and drawing from them to build her characters, she began to develop multi-layered narratives. She finds solace in losing herself in a gripping book, and hopes to one day write a story that would give her readers the same experience."

Her first collection of poems “Poste Restante” came out in 2011. English is a language of choice for Pater because she loves the tongue that neither conjugates nor declinates as opposed to her native Polish. It also pleases her to see the expression on faces that hear her read. And, most readily available faces are English speaking. Pater lives in Lexington, Kentucky."

In 2009, the two commenced a six-year experimental literary endeavor: how to compose and articulate a narrative for two distinctive demographics: poetry enthusiasts and short story admirers. The composition development was as distinctive: Kevin would first write the poem, followed by Ann writing a short story, which served as a continuation, or back story to the initial poem. The two never communicated and/or advised each other how the direction of either piece should unravel. With creative freedom, the two friends continued to build upon their counterpart’s submitted work until the project concluded (the two agreed to end the story at six chapters)."

Her first collection of poems “Poste Restante” came out in 2011. English is a language of choice for Pater because she loves the tongue that neither conjugates nor declinates as opposed to her native Polish. It also pleases her to see the expression on faces that hear her read. And, most readily available faces are English speaking. Pater lives in Lexington, Kentucky."

I want people to be moved by my words – moved to tears, moved to laugh, moved to anger, moved to action. Simply moved. Writing is creating art by manipulating words. It isn’t that I have something to say, it isn’t that I want to become a famous author. I write because I love the process of creating. I write because characters, conflicts, worlds, and images, live in my mind and demand to be shared.

Sometimes when I read a new work, be it from the classical canon or from the just-published shelf, I ponder the author's reincarnation. Am I Dostoevsky? Is E.L.

https://www.sixfold.org/members/thelastbeatpoet,John George Wolfgang Lesko Jr.,"I am a 63 year old native of New York City. My life as a serious poet began in the summer of 1968 when after having returned from sailing the North Atlantic I found myself sharing a houseboat at Gate 5 Sausalito, Ca., about 10 km north of San Francisco. It was a hotbed of creative artists and I rubbed shoulders with the likes of the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and Alan Watts of Zen philosophy renown. The most fortuitous happening for me was when a friend wrote on a scrap of paper, ""Hungry for breath like a kite falling stray, the wire grows slack the child within pulls at the empty air."" The author's name was Jack Campbell. We had grown close, he was ten years my senior and a professor of literature at a Bay Area university. When I commented on its profundity & clarity, his response was that until my pieces could stand alone as a ""complete thought"" I was not a poet. I took it to very much to heart and it has proven to be the bedrock of my authorship. D'Agate"

Trained in the sciences but frustrated with writing in a cold and technical style.

Favourite teller of short story tales is JG Ballard (especially 60s period). So imaginative in ideas and beautifully clean in prose and structure. That's what I'm aiming for - I hate pretentious, overly verbose writing. Love to think I have a novel in me but want to improve my skills at the shorter format first. Enjoy writing topical limericks too - working on one to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Richard Wagner..another hero of mine (musically anyway)."

I recently graduated from the University of Alaska Anchorage with a Bachelors degree in Theatre. I use the education I received on humans during my time in the theatre program to create unbelievably realistic situations that bring out both the best and the worst in human nature. One of my bigger influences is Edward Albee, who has a tendency to lay out moral questions, but not answer them. My goal in writing is to reveal humans for what they are and leave the questions out there of if something is actually wrong or is that going too for. I was just recently accepted into the University of Tampa's MFA program and I'm due residency in June. My goal is to become not only a published writer, but also to teach creative writing at a university level in order to inspire others and help them discover themselves more."

My writing is southern because Faulkner and Styron and Eudora Welty are my chief influences. I was raised by parents with only eighth grade educations in the flat alluvial plain between the Green River and the Ohio River in Kentucky. It of Kentucky and its fabulous citizens that I write most. I have been publishing stories since the age of thirteen when my story ""I Am a Cornflake"" was published in the local paper. My satirical short story ""The Man in the Barn"" is to be published soon in Alligator Juniper. My daughters are both college professors, the oldest graduated from Harvard and the youngest (appropriately enough) from the University of Kentucky. I have published southern literary stories, stories of southern satire, horror and even a confession magazine story when I was in law school. The two hundred and fifty bucks was a boon to our spartan budget. I love writing and reading and books."

I like to think that my poetry is transparent and accessible, traits mainly achieved by writing about others rather than about my interior life. Perhaps I am not ready to fully embrace the rigorous honesty that it takes to write about the self. For now, applying truth by empathy and observation is enough. I of course cannot predict where this nascent trail of words will lead. But I know now that I consider poetry my work and am the richer for it. I hope that my poetry enriches the world as well.

At age 17 I fell in love with my Italian teacher (I was doing a language degree by correspondence) and moved to Sydney to be with him. I gave birth to my first son at age 18 and went on to have 5 children. I dropped out of my degree but returned to it, part time, 5 years ago. I'm now in the equivalent of 3rd year and the majors are in Spanish and Italian. For years I wrote little and only for myself, however a personal crisis provoked by the death of my computer and the loss of everything I'd been working on in the last few years, inspired me to begin writing prolifically again. Working around my 2 year old's naps, I've written a lot of poems in the last few months."

https://www.sixfold.org/members/CarmenColado,Carmen Colado,"I'm Carmen Colado, a 21-year old soldier by profession and poet by disorder. I live in Georgia at the moment but I'm a born and raised Texan, displaced from my beautiful state only by necessity. A.E. Housman and his ""Laws of God, Laws of Man"" poem allowed me to move past my bias against poetry. I had once thought it was all ""Roses are red, violets are blue"" but Housman quickly showed me there can be true meaning behind the beautifully crafted lines of poems. Now every day I use poetry as an escape and a release, as a way to describe the indescribable and make sense of the nonsense."

By that time she had pretty much become a loner, and writing stories was a favorite recreation. “I have notebooks alive with ideas for future stories.” She admits she may never get to all of them, but sometimes a whole story gels from something as simple as a childhood memory or newspaper article.

Still, I have a long climb up that literary ladder ahead of me. Nowadays I’m focusing more on prose, purely because, as challenging as writing poetry is, there’s something profoundly rewarding about telling a story. My major influences are dystopian and science fiction, from Orwell to McCarthy, Asimov to Crichton. But my favourite author remains Stephen King, since he is one of the few writers I’ve ever read who are quite willing, and indeed seem to make it their mission, to forsake the literary weight of ‘classics’ in favour of simply telling a story. After all, isn’t that what writing should be about?"

https://www.sixfold.org/members/russellsaunders,Russell Saunders,"Made in England - the lustrous locks are long gone. Trained in the sciences but frustrated with writing in a cold and technical style. Been writing short stories (flash fiction and up) for a year and trying to win a competition ever since - no luck yet. I'm putting it down to luck! Favourite teller of short story tales is JG Ballard (especially 60s period). So imaginative in ideas and beautifully clean in prose and structure. That's what I'm aiming for - I hate pretentious, overly verbose writing. Love to think I have a novel in me but want to improve my skills at the shorter format first. Enjoy writing topical limericks too - working on one to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Richard Wagner..another hero of mine (musically anyway)."

I am an Appalachian writer, which is funny because I didn't know I was “Appalachian” until I went to college. We never called ourselves that. We were people who worked hard, who led the lives we had to in order to get by. We were never inbred hillbillies as portrayed in movies like Deliverance. We did not dress in overhauls twenty-four seven like some romanticized greeting card pictorial of gentle mountainfolk plucking banjos on the front porch with an uncle named Burl and his little brown and tan jug. The Appalachia I remember was a melting pot of diversity from the urban streets of Knoxville to the many trailer parks on my road. I am a thinker, but I choose to apply my brain to rougher things. I find abandoned junkyards more intriguing than sunsets. I ride a motorcycle for the experience, but also to learn the difference between a carburetor and a fuel filter."

Her main form of poetic inspiration is the human condition in all of its complexities, which carries over to her interest and involvement with Carl Jung and the Jung Institute in Los Angeles. She sees all of life as a metaphor, and tries to view her own personal life as a science experiment. Her poetry often contains a protagonist, who she translates into imagery without a bias. Refinement in her work has come through her relationships with poets Michael Deragon, Rick Bursky, and Richard Garcia workshops. Her current long-term pursuit is towards a degree in analytical psychology, and in using metaphor as a form to help patients understand the unconscious."

That means my work is the result of my personal experience, a product of its historic times. Luckily I have mostly lived in peace and wholeness. The natural world is usually my model, the framework---my theme being the tension between nature and humanity, how we can understand man's machinations as reflected in the world around us. I find myself returning consistently to the red desert world of the American West-- focusing on the particulars of rock and geological forces-- the silence of the landscape, the solitude of the observer. I try to make the sensory life of the earth breathe through my poems using highly concrete images."

We were people who worked hard, who led the lives we had to in order to get by. We were never inbred hillbillies as portrayed in movies like Deliverance. We did not dress in overhauls twenty-four seven like some romanticized greeting card pictorial of gentle mountainfolk plucking banjos on the front porch with an uncle named Burl and his little brown and tan jug. The Appalachia I remember was a melting pot of diversity from the urban streets of Knoxville to the many trailer parks on my road. I am a thinker, but I choose to apply my brain to rougher things.

Some of my poems have been published in Chronogram Magazine, the Mom Egg, the Westchester Review, and Fictionique.com. I'm very excited to share in this process."
