56942,I love being in manhattan
56943,I love the night time. I am in college.
56944,What is your job?
56945,What do you think about ConvAI competition?
56946,"Hey, listen. I love the night time. I am in college."
56947,Ok
56948,Hello!
56949,I have five pets
56950,Hello
56951,I'm so tired from my exams
56952,"My best friend has been up all night with her ex boyfriend, and she seems to have forgotten she has a roommate"
56953,My roots are atrocious! Being a bottle blonde is the worst. Thanks Mom and Dad for the great jeans
56954,My eyes are blue but I wear contacts. I have a weird obsession with having a darker eye color
56955,I dont know how I ended up with Nursing as my major. Anthropology will always be my first love!
56956,"I could talk to myself for hours especially since everyone I know smells like week old chicken. It's gross. They work as waitresses at a supposedly ""high-end"" chicken shack. I'm glad I found a job as a bartender"
56957,Chicken is disgusting. They eat everything.
56958,This is irritating.
56959,If I was alive during the Holocaust I could make an IPO from selling my eggs. Jessie Owens ruined it. Poor black women. It's freaking hilarious when you consider the facts. We dodged a bullet there.
56960,When I think of chicken. I think of a seedy CEO asking me to close his office door so he can face plant into a bag of coke.
56961,Say no to drugs kids. That is unless you want to be a CEO.
56962,Old school doctor's used morphine. During my clinical I saw a surgeon vaping meth.
56963,Most people have found memories of Mister Rodgers. When I think of him I see a manipulative bastard that trained and inspired the next generation of factory workers.
56964,Do you want to know how crayons are made?
56965,"Well kids, Let's take a trip to the crayons factory!"
56966,"Timmy grows up and shoots up the school. If you are wondering how Mister Rodgers and Crayon factories lead to school shooting. My reply is ""Welcome to America""."
56967,"I'm really against violence amongst children. Unfortunately, it's been a trend lately."
56968,I wonder why they don't advertise hot springs anymore.
56969,If you watch a movie from the 70-80's hot springs were pretty popular.
56970,Thermal energy is the wave of the future.
56971,"They say that there will be another ice age. I would be saved, because I'll be a nurse by then."
56972,Imagine small cities built around volcanoes. Harvesting their abundant energy. A Triage powered and heated by lava.
56973,It funny how a Doctor or a Nurse can devote 40 yrs of their life to helping others then one day decide that collecting rocks is their true passion.
56974,I wonder if airports will one day have onsite medical facilities.
56975,"I'm in it for the money. I'll let the CNAs do everything. It'll be easier that way. LPN is a dying field, really!"
56976,Having my roommate as my best friend is fun expect for when he smokes he has trouble with erectile dysfunction.
56977,I could suck on it for hours. He doesn't complain.
56978,I just learned to stuff my self like a turkey and enjoy the ride. I'm not a complicated girl.
56979,"Being blonde has it's perks. Except that one time where my boss asked to cum in my pretty blue eyes. The nerve of him. I told him I needed 20,000 per eye."
56980,Of course he obliged. He's a regular old perv.
56981,My roommate doesn't mind. I remember when we got the gerbil stuck in my bosses anus. He was convinced that since I'm a nurse I should be able to get it out. He paid millions to remain anonymous when the story made a it to the news.
56982,We laugh about it occasionally.
56983,"No one in the office knows. ""Strict professionalism"" is his favorite word. My job at the bar gives me time to recoup."
56984,I wear a red wig and purple contacts when I work at the bar.
56985,It's kind of hilarious. I like to surprise myself when I transform.
56986,My customers love to comment about red heads. The worst comment I've heard referenced my pubes and having a fire crotch.
56987,If I had red pubic hairs I would get it waxed into a heart shape.
56988,My boss and roommate might enjoy it
56989,My roommate is like some Astrophysicist and AI guru. I call him a dick wad.
56990,He is obsessed with the fact that my anus hair is black but my pubes are blonde.
56991,He thinks I might be a chimera.
56992,College is fun
56993,I'm taking courses at three different universities
56994,One of my Professors happens to be the older brother of the dean.
56995,I invited my professor to brunch
56996,"Initially he declined, but I showed him the photos I collected from a PI exposing his ""other"" activities."
56997,"Who would think about drilling holes into a tree, filling it with Twinkies, and banging it."
56998,He does it every Wednesday and Saturday religiously 
56999,He even has a favorite tree.
57000,"Obviously, I'm bored"
57001,Double stuff Oreos are a scam.
57002,I want more cookie and less filling.
57003,Want to hear a joke?
57004,What do you call a blonde blue eyes woman who works at a bar to pay for college?
57005,Bullshit
57006,You call bullshit
57007,I thought I was hilarious.
57008,I honestly believe this was a ploy to see what stereotypes would be expressed by someone impersonating this type of individual.
57009,Humans are humans bro
57010,Dont be an ass.
57011,I know blondes who are intelligent. I know blondes who are genuine relatable air heads.
57012,Their hair color did not determine their personality.
57013,Their eco-socio status did.
